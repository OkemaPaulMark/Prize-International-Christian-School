Here you find a people passionate about the intersection of quality education and God. We are convinced of Education’s transformative power as well articulated by Nelson Mandela in his quote “It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor.” Likewise, we are persuaded by Martin Luther that “Every institution in which men are not unceasingly occupied with the Word of God must become corrupt.” Our deep conviction therefore is that “The knowledge of God through His word tremendously enhances the value of EDUCATION.” Please explore our website to learn and connect more with us.</p>
