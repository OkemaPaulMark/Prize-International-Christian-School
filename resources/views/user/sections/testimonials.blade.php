                Prior to joining Prize, 7-year old Kyra, had not memorized even one scripture verse. What a pleasant surprise it was to her Mom when after one month, she recited Matthew 6:19-24, a whole six verses at once!!! We are so delighted that Kyra is memorizing scripture, adding weapons to her armory.

                During the Term 2 week of prayer and fasting, 10-year old Amani initially struggled and decided to skip the first day of fasting. However, by God’s grace he managed to join in for the remaining four days. During the next Friday when his learning center decided to fast, he enthusiastically joined in. Furthermore, the following Tuesday he decided to spend personal time praying and fasting. As a school, we celebrate Amani for this growth in seeking God's interventions because God rewards those who diligently seek Him.
